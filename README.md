# Project 1: Image Processing API
 Building an API that can be used in two different ways. As a simple placeholder API, the first allows you to place images into your frontend with the size set via URL parameters (and additional stylization if you choose) for rapid prototyping .

 ## TODO
1. API endpoint test
2. Create thumbnail test
3. Documentation
4. Final review
